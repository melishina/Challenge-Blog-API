Challenge: Blog API
================

https://github.com/melishina/Challenge-Blog-API

Here are the requirements for this app:
- Use npm init to initialize your project
- Install uuid, which is a Node package that the blog post model will require, by running npm install uuid from within your folder for this project
- Your app should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.
- GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.
- DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.
- Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.
- Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data to look at when the server starts.
